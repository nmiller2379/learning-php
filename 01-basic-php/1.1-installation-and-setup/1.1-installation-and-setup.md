# Web server

The term can refer to the harder, the software or both of them working together. It can be a computer or a virtual machine. The web server is the one that receives the requests from the clients and sends back the responses. The most common web servers are Apache, Nginx, and IIS.

Apache and Nginx are the two most common web servers. We will use Apache in this course.

We will install XAMPP, which is a package that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. It is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

# In this lesson

We installed XAMPP, which includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. We also learned about the web server and the client-server model.

We opoened the application files and found the htdocs folder, which is the root folder of our application. We also learned about the index.php file, which is the entry point of our application.

In the index.php file, we wrote simply the text 'hello world' and when we went to http://localhost in our web browser, we were able to see the text.

We haven't actually written any PHP code yet, but seeing that text in the web browser helped me understand the client-server model and how the web server works.

I've also got index.php saved hereinside 01-basic-php/1.1-installation-and-setup because I don't yet know what else to do with it. I'm going to leave it here for now.
